# Onet #

In ChainBoost, we used latest version of [Onet](https://github.com/dedis/onet/tree/v3.2.9) (v.3.2.9) at the time for network, simulation, and communication modules

Onet's documents can be find under following link:

The Overlay-network (Onet) is a library for simulation and deployment of
decentralized, distributed protocols. This library offers a framework for
research, simulation, and deployment of crypto-related protocols with an emphasis
on decentralized, distributed protocols. It offers an abstraction for tree-based
communications between thousands of nodes and it is used both in research for
testing out new protocols and running simulations, as well as in production to
deploy those protocols as a service in a distributed manner.
